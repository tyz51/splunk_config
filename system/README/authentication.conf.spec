#   Version 8.0.6
#
# This file contains possible attributes and values for configuring
# authentication via authentication.conf.
#
# There is an authentication.conf file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  To
# set custom configurations, place an authentication.conf in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For examples, see
# authentication.conf.example. You must restart the Splunk platform to enable
# configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files, including precedence, see
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles.

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#     of the file.
#   * Each .conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#     multiple default stanzas, settings are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same setting, the last definition in the
#     file wins.
#   * If a setting is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[authentication]
* Follow this stanza name with any number of the following setting/value
  pairs.

authType = [Splunk|LDAP|Scripted|SAML|ProxySSO]
* Specify which authentication system to use.
* Supported values: Splunk, LDAP, Scripted, SAML, ProxySSO.
* Default: Splunk

authSettings = <authSettings-key>,<authSettings-key>,...
* Key to look up the specific configurations of chosen authentication
  system.
* <authSettings-key> is the name of a stanza header that specifies
  settings for scripted authentication, SAML, ProxySSO and for an LDAP
  strategy. Those stanzas are defined below.
* For LDAP, specify the LDAP strategy name(s) here. If you want Splunk
  software to query multiple LDAP servers, provide a comma-separated list
  of all strategies. Each strategy must be defined in its own stanza.
  The order in which you specify the strategy names is the order Splunk
  software uses to query their servers when looking for a user.
* For scripted authentication, <authSettings-key> should be a single
  stanza name.

passwordHashAlgorithm = [SHA512-crypt|SHA256-crypt|SHA512-crypt-<num_rounds>|SHA256-crypt-<num_rounds>|MD5-crypt]
* This controls how hashed passwords are stored in the
  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd file for the default "Splunk" authType.
* "MD5-crypt" is an algorithm originally developed for FreeBSD in the early
  1990s, which became a widely used standard among UNIX machines. Splunk
  Enterprise also used it through the 5.0.x releases. MD5-crypt runs the
  salted password through a sequence of 1000 MD5 operations.
* "SHA256-crypt" and "SHA512-crypt" are newer versions that use 5000 rounds
  of the Secure Hash Algorithm-256 (SHA256) or SHA512 hash functions.
  This is slower than MD5-crypt and therefore more resistant to dictionary
  attacks.  SHA512-crypt is used for system passwords on many versions of Linux.
* These SHA-based algorithm can optionally be followed by a number of rounds
  to use. For example, "SHA512-crypt-10000" uses twice as many rounds
  of hashing as the default implementation. The number of rounds must be at
  least 1000.
  If you specify a very large number of rounds (i.e. more than 20x the
  default value of 5000), splunkd might become unresponsive and connections to
  splunkd (from Splunk Web or CLI) time out.
* This setting only affects new password settings (either when a user is
  added or a user's password is changed).  Existing passwords work but retain their
  previous hashing algorithm.
* Default: SHA512-crypt

defaultRoleIfMissing = <splunk role>
* Applicable for LDAP authType. If the LDAP server does not return any groups, or if
  groups cannot be mapped to Splunk roles, then this value is used, if provided.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string

externalTwoFactorAuthVendor = <string>
* A valid multifactor vendor string enables multifactor authentication
  and loads support for the corresponding vendor if supported by the Splunk software.
* An empty string disables multifactor authentication in the Splunk software.
* Currently Splunk supports Duo and RSA as multifactor authentication vendors.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

externalTwoFactorAuthSettings = <externalTwoFactorAuthSettings-key>
* Key to look up the specific configuration of chosen multifactor
  authentication vendor.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

# LDAP settings
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
* Follow this stanza name with the following setting/value pairs.
* For multiple strategies, specify multiple instances of
  this stanza, each with its own stanza name and a separate set of
  settings.
* The <authSettings-key> must be one of the values listed in the
  authSettings setting, which must be specified in the previous [authentication]
  stanza.

host = <string>
* The hostname of the LDAP server.
* Confirm that your Splunk server can resolve the host name through DNS.
* Required.
* No default.

SSLEnabled = [0|1]
* Specifies whether SSL is enabled.
* See the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/openldap/ldap.conf for SSL LDAP settings
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 0 (disabled)

port = <integer>
* The port that Splunk software should use to connect to your LDAP server.
* This setting is optional.
* Default (non-SSL): 389
* Default (SSL): 636

bindDN = <string>
* The LDAP Distinguished Name of the user that retrieves the LDAP entries.
* This user must have read access to all LDAP users and groups you wish to
  use in the auth system.
* This setting is optional.
* Leave this setting blank to retrieve your LDAP entries using
  anonymous bind (which must be supported by the LDAP server)
* No default.

bindDNpassword = <password>
* Password for the bindDN user.
* This setting is optional.
* Leave this blank if anonymous bind is sufficient.
* No default.

userBaseDN = <string>
* The distinguished names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain the users.
* Enter a ';' delimited list to search multiple trees.
* Required.
* No default.

userBaseFilter = <string>
* The LDAP search filter to use when searching for users.
* Highly recommended, especially when there are many entries in your LDAP
  user subtrees.
* When used properly, search filters can significantly speed up LDAP queries
* Here is an example that matches users in the IT or HR department:
    * userBaseFilter = (|(department=IT)(department=HR))
    * See RFC 2254 for more detailed information on search filter syntax
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string (no filtering)

userNameAttribute = <string>
* This is the username.
* NOTE: This setting should use case insensitive matching for its values,
  and the values should not contain whitespace
    * Usernames are case insensitive in the Splunk software
* In Active Directory, this is 'sAMAccountName'
* Required.
* A typical value is 'uid'.
* No default.

realNameAttribute = <string>
* The user's real, human readable name.
* Required.
* A typical value is 'cn'.
* No default.

emailAttribute = <string>
* The user's email address.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: mail

groupMappingAttribute = <string>
* The value that group entries use to declare membership.
* Groups are often mapped with user DN, so this defaults to 'dn'
* Set this if groups are mapped using a different setting
  * Usually only needed for OpenLDAP servers.
  * A typical setting is 'uid'
    * For example, assume a group declares that one of its members is
      'splunkuser' â€” every user with the 'uid' value 'splunkuser' is
      mapped to that group.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

groupBaseDN = [<string>;<string>;...]
* The LDAP Distinguished Names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain
  the groups.
* Required.
* Enter a semicolon (;) delimited list to search multiple trees.
* If your LDAP environment does not have group entries, there is a
  configuration that can treat each user as its own group:
  * Set groupBaseDN to the same as userBaseDN, which means you search
    for groups in the same place as users.
  * Next, set the groupMemberAttribute and groupMappingAttribute to the same
    setting as userNameAttribute.
    * This means the entry, when treated as a group, uses the username
      value as its only member.
  * For clarity, also set groupNameAttribute to the same
    value as userNameAttribute.
* No default.

groupBaseFilter = <string>
* The LDAP search filter Splunk software uses when searching for static groups
* Like 'userBaseFilter', this is highly recommended to speed up LDAP queries
* See Request for Comments (RFC) 2254 on the Internet Engineering Task Force
  (IETF) website for more information.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string (no filtering).

dynamicGroupFilter = <string>
* The LDAP search filter Splunk software uses when searching for dynamic groups.
* Configure this setting only if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups
  on your LDAP server.
* Example: '(objectclass=groupOfURLs)'
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string

dynamicMemberAttribute = <string>
* This setting contains the LDAP URL needed to retrieve members dynamically.
* Only configure this if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups on your
  LDAP server.
* This setting is required if you want to retrieve dynamic groups.
* Otherwise, it is optional.
* Example: 'memberURL'
* No default.

groupNameAttribute = <string>
* This is the group entry setting whose value stores the group name.
* A typical setting for this is 'cn' (common name)
* Recall that if you are configuring LDAP to treat user entries as their own
  group, user entries must have this setting
* Required.
* Default: empty string

groupMemberAttribute = <string>
* This is the group entry setting whose values are the groups members
* Typical setting for this are 'member' and 'memberUid'
* For example, consider the groupMappingAttribute example above using
  groupMemberAttribute 'member'
  * To declare 'splunkuser' as a group member, its setting 'member' must
    have the value 'splunkuser'
* Required.
* Default: empty string

nestedGroups = <boolean>
* Controls whether Splunk software expands nested groups using the
  'memberof' extension.
* Set to 1 if you have nested groups you want to expand and the 'memberof'
  extension on your LDAP server.
* This setting is optional.

charset = <string>
* Only set this for an LDAP setup that returns non-UTF-8 encoded data. LDAP
  is supposed to always return UTF-8 encoded data (See RFC 2251), but some
  tools incorrectly return other encodings.
* Follows the same format as 'CHARSET' in props.conf (see props.conf.spec)
* An example value would be "latin-1"
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string

anonymous_referrals = [0|1]
* Set this to 0 to turn off referral chasing
* Set this to 1 to turn on anonymous referral chasing
* NOTE: Splunk software only chases referrals using anonymous bind.
        It does not support rebinding using credentials.
* If you do not need referral support, set this to 0.
* If you wish to make referrals work, set this to 1 and conirm your server
  allows anonymous searching
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 1

sizelimit = <integer>
* Limits the amount of entries that Splunk software requests in LDAP search.
* NOTE: The max entries returned is still subject to the maximum
        imposed by your LDAP server.
  * Example: If you set this to 5000 and the server limits it to 1000,
             the software only returns 1000 entries.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 1000

pagelimit = <integer>
* The maximum number of entries to return in each page.
* Enables result sets that exceed the maximum number of entries defined for the
  LDAP server.
* If set to -1, ldap pagination is off.
* IMPORTANT: The maximum number of entries a page returns is subject to
  the maximum page size limit of the LDAP server. For example: If you set 'pagelimit =
  5000' and the server limit is 1000, you cannot receive more than 1000 entries in
  a page.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: -1

enableRangeRetrieval = <boolean>
* The maximum number of values that can be retrieved from one attribute in a
  single LDAP search request is determined by the LDAP server. If the number of
  users in a group exceeds the LDAP server limit, enabling this setting fetches all
  users by using the "range retrieval" mechanism.
* Enables result sets for a given attribute that exceed the maximum number of
  values defined for the LDAP server.
* If set to false, ldap range retrieval is off.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: false

timelimit = <integer>
* Limits the amount of time, in seconds, that Splunk software waits for an LDAP search
  request to complete.
* If your searches finish quickly, lower this value from the default.
* Maximum value is 30 seconds
* Default: 15

network_timeout = <integer>
* Limits the amount of time a socket polls a connection without activity
* This is useful for determining if your LDAP server cannot be reached
* NOTE: As a connection could be waiting for search results, this value
        must be higher than 'timelimit'.
* Like 'timelimit', if you have a fast connection to your LDAP server,
  lower this value.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 20

ldap_negative_cache_timeout = <nonnegative decimal>
* The amount of time, in seconds, that Splunk software remembers that a non-existent
  user on an LDAP provider does not exist.
* This setting is useful when you want to avoid frequent LDAP queries for users
  that do not exist on the LDAP provider.
* This setting does not prevent LDAP queries on login. Login always queries the LDAP
  provider to confirm that a user exists.
* Default: 86400

#####################
# Map roles
#####################

[roleMap_<authSettings-key>]
* The mapping of Splunk roles to LDAP groups for the LDAP strategy specified
  by <authSettings-key>
* Follow this stanza name with several Role-to-Group(s) mappings as defined
  below.
* NOTE: This role mapping ONLY applies to the specified strategy.
* Importing groups for the same user from different strategies is not
  supported.

<Splunk RoleName> = <LDAP group string>
* Maps a Splunk role (from authorize.conf) to LDAP groups
* This LDAP group list is semicolon delimited (no spaces).
* List several of these setting/value pairs to map several Splunk roles to
  LDAP Groups

#####################
# Scripted authentication
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
* Follow this stanza name with the following setting/value pairs:

python.version = {default|python|python2|python3}
* For Python scripts only, selects which Python version to use.
* Set to either "default" or "python" to use the system-wide default Python
  version.
* Optional.
* Default: Not set; uses the system-wide Python version.

scriptSearchFilters = [1|0]
* Whether or not to call the script to add search filters.
* Set this to 1 to call the script to add search filters.
* Default: 0

[cacheTiming]
* Use these settings to adjust how long Splunk software uses the answers returned
  from script functions before calling them again.
* All timeouts can be expressed in seconds or as a search-like time range
* Examples include "30" (30 seconds), "2mins" (2 minutes), "24h" (24 hours), etc.
* You can opt to use no caching for a particular function by setting the
  value to "0".
  * Be aware that this can severely hinder performance as a result of heavy
    script invocation.
* Choosing the correct values for cache timing involves a tradeoff between
  new information latency and general performance.
  * High values yield better performance from calling the script less, but
    introduces a latency in picking up changes.
  * Low values pick up changes in your external auth system more
    quickly, but can slow down performance due to increased script
    invocations.

userLoginTTL = <time range string>
* The timeout for the 'userLogin' script function.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* Default: 0 (no caching)

getUserInfoTTL = <time range string>
* How long the auth system caches information that it retrieves with the
  'getUserInfo' script.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* Default: 10s

getUsersTTL = <time range string>
* The timeout for the getUsers script function.
* There is only one global getUsers cache (it is not tied to a
  specific user).
* Default: 10s

* The port where SAML responses are sent.
* Typically, this is the web port.
* If internal port redirection is needed, set this port and the
  'assertionconsumerServiceUrl' in the AuthNRequest contains this port
  instead of the Splunk Web port.
* To prevent any port information to be appended in the
  'assertionConsumerServiceUrl' setting, set this to 0.
* No default.

idpSSOUrl = <url>
* The protocol endpoint on the IDP (Identity Provider) where the
  AuthNRequests should be sent.
* Required.
* SAML requests fail if this information is missing.
* No default.

* If the SAML response is to be verified with a IdP (Identity Provider) certificate that
  is self signed, then this setting holds the filename of the certificate.
* If the SAML response is to be verified with a certificate that is a part of a
  certificate chain(root, intermediate(s), leaf), create a subdirectory and place the
  certificate chain as files in the subdirectory.
* If there are multiple end certificates, create a subdirectory such that, one
  subdirectory holds one certificate chain.
* If multiple such certificate chains are present, the assertion is considered verified,
  if validation succeeds with any certificate chain.
* The file names within a certificate chain should be such that root certificate
  is alphabetically before the intermediate which is alphabetically before of
  the end cert.
  ex. cert_1.pem has the root, cert_2.pem has the first intermediate cert,
      cert_3.pem has the second intermediate certificate and cert_4.pem has the

issuerId = <string>
* Required.
* The unique identifier of the identity provider.
  The value of this setting corresponds to the setting "entityID" of
  "EntityDescriptor" node in IdP metadata document.
* If you configure SAML using IdP metadata, this field is extracted from
  the metadata.
* If you configure SAML manually, then you must configure this setting.
* When Splunk software tries to verify the SAML response, the issuerId
  specified here must match the 'Issuer' field in the SAML response. Otherwise,
  validation of the SAML response fails.

signAuthnRequest = <boolean>
* Whether or not Splunk software should sign AuthNRequests.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: true

signedAssertion = <boolean>
* Whether or not the SAML assertion has been signed by the IDP.

  need to create this directory before you install your script there.
* You must copy the 'commonAuth.py' script from the shared script
  examples directory to this directory after you install your script.
  The script relies on 'commonAuth.py' to run successfully.
* The shared script examples directory is typically located at
  $SPLUNK_HOME/share/splunk/authScriptSamples, but you can

  with tokens and saved searches.
* This setting controls how long the auth system caches information that it
  retrieves with the 'getUserInfo' script function.
* This setting does not control how the method retrieves user information
  when one logs in using the standard SAML login flow through a browser.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
