# OVERVIEW
############################################################################
# This file contains possible attribute and value pairs for:
#  * Telling Splunk how to handle multi-value fields.
#  * Distinguishing indexed and extracted fields.
#  * Improving search performance by telling the search processor how to
#    handle field values.
#
# Each stanza controls different search commands settings.
#
# There is a fields.conf file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/ directory.
# Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory.
# The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original
# location.
#
# To set custom configurations, create a new file with the name fields.conf in
# the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/ directory. Then add the specific settings
# that you want to customize to the local configuration file.
# For examples, see fields.conf.example.
# You must restart the Splunk instance to enable configuration changes.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including file precedence) see the
# documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
############################################################################
#
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of
#     the file.
#   * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#     multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in the
#     file wins.
#   * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[<field name>]
* Name of the field that you are configuring.
* Follow this stanza name with any number of the following attribute/value
  pairs.
* Field names can contain only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and  _, but cannot begin with a
  number or _

# 'TOKENIZER' enables you to indicate that a field value is a smaller part of a
# token. For example, your raw event has a field with the value "abc123", but
# you need this field to to be a multivalue field with both "abc" and â€œ123" as
# values.
TOKENIZER = <regular expression>
* Use this setting to configure multivalue fields (refer to the online
  documentation for multivalue fields).
* A regular expression that indicates how the field can take on multiple values
  at the same time.
* If empty, the field can only take on a single value.
* Otherwise, the first group is taken from each match to form the set of
  values.
* This setting is used by the "search" and "where" commands, the summary and
  XML outputs of the asynchronous search API, and by the "top", "timeline", and
  "stats" commands.
* Tokenization of indexed fields (INDEXED = true) is not supported so this
  attribute is ignored for indexed fields.
* No default.

INDEXED = <boolean>
* Indicates whether a field is indexed.
* Set to "true" if the field is indexed.
* Set to "false" for fields extracted at search time. This accounts for the
  majority of fields.
* Default: false

INDEXED_VALUE = [true|false|<sed-cmd>|<simple-substitution-string>]
* Set to "true" if the value is in the raw text of the event.
* Set to "false" if the value is not in the raw text of the event.
* Setting this to "true" expands any search for key=value into a search of
  value AND key=value (since value is indexed).
* For advanced customization, this setting supports sed style substitution.
  For example, 'INDEXED_VALUE=s/foo/bar/g' would take the value of the field,
  replace all instances of 'foo' with 'bar,' and use that new value as the
  value to search in the index.
* This setting also supports a simple substitution based on looking for the
  literal string '<VALUE>' (including the '<' and '>' characters).
  For example, 'INDEXED_VALUE=source::*<VALUE>*' would take a search for
  'myfield=myvalue' and search for 'source::*myvalue*' in the index as a
  single term.
* For both substitution constructs, if the resulting string starts with a '[',
  Splunk interprets the string as a Splunk LISPY expression.  For example,
  'INDEXED_VALUE=[OR <VALUE> source::*<VALUE>]' would turn 'myfield=myvalue'
  into applying the LISPY expression '[OR myvalue source::*myvalue]' (meaning
  it matches either 'myvalue' or 'source::*myvalue' terms).
* NOTE: You only need to set 'indexed_value' if "indexed = false".
* Default: true
