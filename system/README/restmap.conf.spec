# Version 8.0.6
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for creating new
# Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoints.

# There is a restmap.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/. To set custom
# configurations, place a restmap.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For
# examples, see restmap.conf.example. You must restart Splunk software to
# enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see
# the documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles
#
# NOTE: You must register every REST endpoint via this file to make it available.

####
# GLOBAL SETTINGS
####

# Use the [global] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#     of the file.
#   * Each .conf file should have at most one global stanza. If there are
#     multiple global stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in
#     the file wins.
#   * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[global]

allowGetAuth = <boolean>
* Allows the username/password to be passed as a GET parameter to endpoint
  services/authorization/login.
* Setting to "true" might result in your username and password getting
  logged as cleartext in Splunk's logs and any proxy servers in between.
* Default: false

allowRestReplay = <boolean>
* Allows POST/PUT/DELETE requests to be replayed on other nodes in the deployment.
* Setting to "true" enables centralized management.
* You can also control replay at each endpoint level.
* CAUTION: This feature is currently internal. Do not enable it
  without consulting Splunk support.
* Default: false

defaultRestReplayStanza = <string>
* Points to the default, or global, REST replay configuration stanza.
* This setting is related to the 'allowRestReplay' setting.
* Default: restreplayshc

pythonHandlerPath = <path>
* Path to 'main' python script handler.
* Used by the script handler to determine where the actual 'main' script is
  located.
* You do not typically need to edit this setting.
* Default: $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/rest_handler.py

[<rest endpoint name>:<endpoint description string>]
* Settings under this stanza are applicable to all REST stanzas.
* Settings in other stanzas might supply additional information.

match = <path>
* Specify the URI that calls the handler.
* For example, if match=/foo, then https://$SERVER:$PORT/services/foo calls this
  handler.
* NOTE: You must start your path with a "/".

requireAuthentication = <boolean>
* Determines if this endpoint requires authentication.
* Optional.
* Default: true

authKeyStanza = <string>
* Determines the location of the pass4SymmKey in the
  server.conf file to be used for endpoint authentication.
* Optional. This setting is only applicable if the
  'requireAuthentication' setting is set to "true".
* Default: general

restReplay = <boolean>
* Enables REST replay on this endpoint group.
* Optional.
* Related to the 'allowRestReplay' setting.
* CAUTION: This feature is currently internal. Do not
  enable it without consulting Splunk support.
* Default: false

restReplayStanza = <string>
* This setting points to a stanza that can override the
  [global]/defaultRestReplayStanza value on a per-endpoint/regex basis.
* Default: empty string

capability = <capabilityName>
capability.<post|delete|get|put> = <capabilityName>
* Depending on the HTTP method, check capabilities on the authenticated session user.
* If you use the 'capability.<post|delete|get|put>' setting, the associated method is
  checked against the authenticated user's role.
* If you use the 'capability' setting, all calls are checked against this
  capability regardless of the HTTP method.
* You can also express capabilities as a boolean expression.
  Supported operators include: or, and, ()

acceptFrom = <comma-separated list>
* A list of networks or addresses from which to allow this endpoint to be accessed.
* Do not confuse this setting with the identical setting in the
  [httpServer] stanza of server.conf which controls whether a host can
  make HTTP requests at all.
* Each rule can be in the following forms:
    1. A single IPv4 or IPv6 address (examples: "10.1.2.3", "fe80::4a3")
    2. A CIDR block of addresses (examples: "10/8", "fe80:1234/32")
    3. A DNS name, possibly with a '*' used as a wildcard (examples:
       "myhost.example.com", "*.splunk.com")
    4. A single '*' which matches anything.
* You can also prefix entries with '!' to cause the rule to reject the
  connection. Rules are applied in order, and the first one to match is
  used. For example, "!10.1/16, *" allows connections from everywhere
  except the 10.1.*.* network.
* Default: "*" (accept from anywhere)

includeInAccessLog = <boolean>
* Whether to include requests to this endpoint in the splunkd_access.log.
* If set to "true", requests appear in splunkd_access.log.

* The file must be located in an application's bin subdirectory.
* For example, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<APPNAME>/bin/TestHandler.py has a class
  called MyHandler (which, in the case of python must be derived from a base
  class called 'splunk.rest.BaseRestHandler'). The attribute/value pair for it is:
  "handler=TestHandler.MyHandler".

xsl = <string>
* The path to an XSL transform file.
* Perform an XSL transform on data returned from the handler.
* Optional. Only use this setting if the data is in XML format.

* The path to a script executable.
* If the 'scripttype' setting is set to "python", this setting is optional.
  It lets you run a script which is *not* derived from
  'splunk.rest.BaseRestHandler'. This setting is rarely used.

  the path which is sent to the driver to execute. In that case,
  environment variables are substituted.

script.arg.<N> = <string>

* Endpoints that share the same driver configuration can share processes.
* Environment variables are substituted.
* Default: the persistconn/appserver.py server.

driver.arg.<n> = <string>
* If the 'scripttype' setting is set to "persist", specifies
  the command to start a persistent server for this process.
* Environment variables are substituted.
* Only takes effect when "driver" is specifically set.

driver.env.<name> = <string>
* If the 'scripttype' setting is set to "persist", specifies
  an environment variable to set when running the driver process.

passConf = <boolean>
* If set, the script is sent the contents of this
  configuration stanza as part of the request.
* Only has effect if the 'scripttype' setting is set to "persist".
* Default: true

passPayload = [true|false|base64]
* If set to "true", sends the driver the raw, unparsed body of the
  POST/PUT as a "payload" string.
* If set to "base64", the same body is instead base64-encoded and
  sent as a "payload_base64" string.
* Only has effect if the 'scripttype' setting is set to "persist".
* Default: false

passSession = <boolean>
* If set to "true", sends the driver information about the user's
  session. This includes the user's name, an active authtoken,
  and other details.

<field> = <validation-rule>
* <field> is the name of the field whose value is validated when an
  object is being saved.
* <validation-rule> is an eval expression using the validate() function to
  evaluate argument correctness and return an error message. If you use a boolean
  returning function, a generic message is displayed.
* <handler-name> is the name of the REST endpoint that this stanza applies to.
  handler-name is what is used to access the handler via
  /servicesNS/<user>/<app/admin/<handler-name>.
* For example:
  action.email.sendresult = validate( isbool('action.email.sendresults'), "'action.email.sendresults' must be a boolean value").
* NOTE: Use "'" or "$" to enclose field names that contain non-alphanumeric characters.
